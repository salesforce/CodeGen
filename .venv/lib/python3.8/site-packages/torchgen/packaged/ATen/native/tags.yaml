# This yaml file contains all the possible tags that can be defined in `tags` in `native_functions.yaml`

- tag: inplace_view
  desc: |
          This tag indicates if an operator *only* modifies the tensor metadata
- tag: view_copy
  desc: |
          This tag indicates operators that are *_copy* variants
          of view/aliasing operators. If an operator has a view_copy tag,
          then it should have the name {op}_copy, where {op} is a view operator.
